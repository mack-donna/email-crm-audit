2. **Senior Marketing Leadership** positions at AI-first technology companies 
3. **Google Cloud AI Marketing** roles (given your suggestion about their enterprise focus)

**Why This Focus Makes Sense:**

- **Skill**: 20+ years bridging technical and business teams, plus current AI marketing expertise
- **Demand**: Every large company needs AI strategy leadership (as you noted with your client work)
- **Economics**: Senior roles provide the stability and compensation I need

**Immediate Value I Bring:**
- Hands-on experience with AI marketing tools through Sentient SF
