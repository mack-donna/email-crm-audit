# Architectural Decision Framework
## Personalized Email Outreach Automation System

### Decision Framework Methodology

For each component, we evaluate three key trade-off dimensions:
- **Human vs AI vs Automation**: Where does human expertise add most value?
- **API vs MCP vs Manual**: What provides best reliability/control balance?  
- **Speed/Cost vs Flexibility/Control**: Optimize for execution or sophistication?

---

## Component 1: CSV Processing and Contact Management

### **DECISION: Human + Automation**

**Approach**: Pure Python automation with human validation checkpoints

**Reasoning**:
- **Human Value**: Data quality validation, business rule definition
- **Automation Value**: Parsing, standardization, error detection
- **AI Value**: Minimal - this is structured data processing

**Technical Choice**: 
- **Primary**: Python `pandas` + `csv` libraries
- **Storage**: JSON files for processed data (simple, readable, version-controllable)
- **Validation**: Automated checks with human-readable error reports

**Implementation Priority**: High - Foundation for everything else

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Fast implementation, reliable, debuggable
- ✅ Full control over data validation rules
- ❌ Not automatically adaptable to different CSV formats (acceptable - we control the export)

---

## Component 2: Email History Search and Analysis

### **DECISION: API + AI-Assisted Analysis**

**Approach**: Gmail API for data access + AI for interaction analysis

**Reasoning**:
- **API Access**: Gmail API provides reliable, comprehensive email access
- **Human Oversight**: Review search results, validate relationship categorization
- **AI Analysis**: Extract sentiment, relationship warmth, context summaries

**Technical Choice**:
- **Primary**: Gmail API with OAuth2 authentication
- **Analysis**: Claude API for email content analysis and summarization
- **Caching**: Local JSON storage for API responses (rate limiting + speed)

**Implementation Priority**: High - Critical for personalization quality

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Comprehensive email access, official API reliability
- ✅ AI handles nuanced relationship analysis
- ❌ Requires OAuth setup, API rate limits (manageable with caching)

---

## Component 3: Public Information Research System

### **DECISION: Multi-Modal Approach with Graceful Degradation**

**Approach**: Layered research strategy prioritizing reliability over comprehensiveness

**Architecture**:
1. **Tier 1 (High Reliability)**: Company websites, press releases via web scraping
2. **Tier 2 (Medium Reliability)**: LinkedIn via MCP tools if available
3. **Tier 3 (Opportunistic)**: News APIs, industry databases where accessible

**Reasoning**:
- **Flexibility**: System works even when some sources unavailable
- **Control**: Direct web scraping for critical company information
- **Compliance**: Focus on publicly accessible information

**Technical Choice**:
- **Primary**: `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- **Enhancement**: MCP tools where available for LinkedIn, news
- **Fallback**: Manual research prompts when automation fails

**Implementation Priority**: Medium - Start with basic company research, expand gradually

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Reliable core functionality, respects rate limits/ToS
- ✅ Graceful degradation maintains system operation
- ❌ Limited depth compared to full LinkedIn integration (acceptable for MVP)

## Component 4: Context Analysis and Email Generation

### **DECISION: AI-Primary with Human Coaching Framework**

**Approach**: Claude API for generation + structured human feedback system

**Reasoning**:
- **AI Strength**: Pattern recognition, natural language generation
- **Human Strength**: Business judgment, personalization quality assessment
- **Learning Loop**: Capture human feedback to improve future generations

**Technical Choice**:
- **Generation**: Claude API with structured prompts
- **Coaching**: Conversation-based feedback capture system
- **Templates**: Human-defined email structures with AI personalization

**Implementation Priority**: High - Core value delivery

**Architecture Innovation**: 
```python
class EmailCoachingSystem:
    def generate_draft(self, context, feedback_history)
    def capture_human_feedback(self, draft, human_edits)
    def learn_from_patterns(self, successful_emails)
```

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Leverages AI strengths, captures human expertise
- ✅ Improves over time through feedback
- ❌ Requires iterative coaching investment (valuable long-term)

---

## Component 5: Review and Sending Workflow

### **DECISION: Human-Controlled with Streamlined Interface**

**Approach**: Command-line interface optimized for rapid review/approval

**Reasoning**:
- **Human Control**: Final sending decision always human
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined review process, not email client integration
- **Flexibility**: Easy editing, approval, or rejection

**Technical Choice**:
- **Interface**: Rich command-line interface with clear formatting
- **Workflow**: Show context + draft + edit options + approve/reject
- **Output**: Export approved emails for manual sending (not auto-send)

**Implementation Priority**: High - Essential for user trust and safety

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Full human control, prevents automated mistakes
- ✅ Fast review process for batch operations  
- ❌ Not fully automated (acceptable - humans needed for relationship management)

---

## Component 6: Data Storage for Future Learning

### **DECISION: Structured JSON with SQLite Migration Path**

**Approach**: Start simple, evolve toward database as data grows

**Reasoning**:
- **Phase 1**: JSON files for transparency, version control, easy debugging
- **Phase 2**: SQLite for complex queries, relationship analysis
- **Future**: Could migrate to full database for advanced analytics

**Technical Choice**:
- **Current**: JSON files with clear schema
- **Next**: SQLite with migration scripts
- **Structure**: Designed for ML feature engineering

**Data Architecture**:
```json
{
  "contacts": {...},
  "interactions": {...},
  "research_findings": {...},
  "email_campaigns": {...},
  "success_metrics": {...},
  "learning_data": {...}
}
```

**Implementation Priority**: Medium - Foundation for learning features

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ✅ Simple, debuggable, version-controllable
- ✅ Clear migration path to more sophisticated storage
- ❌ Limited query capabilities initially (acceptable for MVP)
