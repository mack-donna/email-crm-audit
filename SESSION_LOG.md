# Email Outreach Automation - Development Session Log

## Session 1: Solution Design & Architecture (Date: 2025-01-21)

### Completed Work

**Phase 1: Documentation & Architecture Design**
- ✅ Created `OUTREACH_AUTOMATION_SOLUTION_SPEC.md`
  - High-level user story and business value proposition
  - Detailed 6-phase workflow (26 steps)
  - 8 technical components with clear responsibilities
  - Learning-ready data structures for future AI enhancement

- ✅ Created `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` 
  - Decision framework for Human vs AI vs Automation
  - Technology choices for each component
  - Implementation roadmap (6-week plan)
  - Success metrics and architectural principles

### Key Decisions Made

**System Architecture**: Modular Python CLI with API integrations
**Core Approach**: Execution over sophistication, human-AI partnership
**Technology Stack**: 
- Python (pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup)
- Gmail API + Claude API
- JSON → SQLite data progression
- Command-line interface for human review

### Next Steps
- **Phase 2, Module 1**: CSV Contact Processing implementation
- Need to define specific CSV format/fields from Salesforce
- Build foundation with comprehensive logging and testing

### Session Notes
- User wants personalized email outreach automation
- Focus on business development use case
- Transform cold Salesforce contacts into warm outreach
- Target: 3x velocity improvement, 15-25% response rates
- Commercial potential as service offering

### Files Created
- `OUTREACH_AUTOMATION_SOLUTION_SPEC.md`
- `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this file)
