# Email Outreach Automation System

An intelligent system that transforms cold Salesforce contacts into personalized email outreach campaigns by analyzing Gmail interaction history and researching public information.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tool helps business development professionals:
- **Save time**: Reduce contact research from 15-30 minutes to 2-3 minutes per contact
- **Personalize at scale**: Generate tailored emails for 50+ contacts daily
- **Improve response rates**: Target 15-25% response rates through intelligent personalization
- **Learn and improve**: System gets smarter with each use through feedback capture

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a modular design with 8 components:

1. **CSV Contact Processing** ✅ - Import and validate Salesforce exports
2. **Email History Analyzer** ✅ - Gmail API integration for interaction history
3. **Public Information Research** 🚧 - Multi-source company/contact research
4. **Context Intelligence Engine** 🚧 - Information synthesis and analysis
5. **Email Generation System** 🚧 - AI-powered personalized email creation
6. **Human Review Interface** 🚧 - Streamlined approval workflow
7. **Learning Engine** 🚧 - Pattern recognition and improvement
8. **Workflow Orchestrator** 🚧 - End-to-end process management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7+ or 3.x
- Google Cloud account (for Gmail API)
- CSV export from Salesforce with contacts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mack-donna/email-crm-audit.git
cd email-crm-audit
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

### Module 1: Process Salesforce Contacts

```bash
python contact_processor.py
```

This will:
- Load CSV files with flexible field name matching
- Validate required fields (Name, Email, Company)
- Generate structured JSON output with contact data
- Create detailed quality reports

### Module 2: Analyze Email History

1. First, set up Gmail API access following [GMAIL_API_SETUP.md](GMAIL_API_SETUP.md)

2. Run the email analyzer:
```bash
python email_history_analyzer.py
```

This will:
- Authenticate with Gmail (browser popup on first run)
- Search for email interactions with contacts
- Extract interaction patterns and relationship warmth
- Generate structured data for personalization

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Phase 1**: Solution design and architecture
- **Module 1**: CSV contact processing with validation
- **Module 2**: Gmail API integration and email analysis

### 🚧 In Progress
- **Module 3**: Public information research system
- **Module 4**: AI-powered email generation

### 📅 Roadmap
- **Week 1-2**: Core foundation (CSV + Gmail) ✅
- **Week 3-4**: Research + AI generation
- **Week 5-6**: Integration + production features

## 🔧 Technical Details

### GitHub Actions
The repository includes automated CI/CD workflows that:
- Test Python compatibility across versions 2.7-3.10
- Validate documentation completeness
- Run weekly security scans on dependencies
- Generate test reports and code metrics

### Design Principles
- **Modular**: Each component works independently for easy testing
- **Learning-ready**: Data structures designed for future ML enhancement
- **Execution-focused**: Working system first, sophistication later
- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI assists but humans maintain control

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python (stdlib focus for compatibility)
- **APIs**: Gmail API, Claude API (coming soon)
- **Storage**: JSON files → SQLite (future)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debugging support
