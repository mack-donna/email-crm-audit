Subject: Quick question about your recent Matax updates, Dan

Hi Dan,

Hope you had a chance to enjoy the summer! It's been a few months since our last chat in August, and I wanted to check in. I've always appreciated your insights on bookkeeping automation, especially that discussion we had about streamlining month-end processes.

I noticed you've been making some interesting moves at Matax lately, and I'd love to learn more about how your workflow has evolved since we last spoke. Given your focus on efficiency and accuracy in bookkeeping, I thought you might be interested in some new developments we've been working on that align with what you've previously mentioned as priorities.

Would you be open to a brief catch-up call next week? I'd value your perspective, and I can share some specific ideas that might complement your current processes at Matax. Let me know what works best for your schedule.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. I still remember that clever Excel shortcut you shared during our last meeting - it's become a regular part of my workflow!

EMAIL 3 - To: Chun Wong (cwong@safeharborcpa.com)
------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Quick catch-up on your 2025 tax planning, Chun?

Hi Chun,

It's great to reconnect after our discussion last month about the real estate investment trust considerations for your clients. I've been thinking about our conversation, particularly your concerns about the new international reporting requirements.

Given that we're heading into Q4, I wanted to circle back about potentially collaborating on tax planning strategies for your high-net-worth clients. Based on our previous work together, I know how meticulous you are about staying ahead of regulatory changes, and I've recently come across some updates that might interest you, especially regarding cross-border transactions.

Would you be open to a brief call next week? I'd love to hear how your practice has evolved since we last spoke and share some insights that could complement your existing tax advisory services. I'm flexible on timing and can work around your schedule.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. Thanks again for your input during our August 5th meeting â€“ your perspective on the new California state tax regulations was particularly helpful.

EMAIL 4 - To: Katie Boysen (katie@katieboysen.com)
------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Quick follow-up from our August conversation, Katie

Hi Katie,

I hope you had a great end of summer. I was just looking back at our conversation from August 20th about your marketing initiatives at Smith Point Capital, and it made me think about some insights that might be relevant to what you were planning.

Given your focus on expanding Smith Point's market presence, I wanted to share a few ideas that could complement the strategies we previously discussed. I particularly think there might be some interesting opportunities to build on your existing marketing framework while incorporating some of the newer approaches we've seen work well in the financial services sector.

Would you be open to a brief catch-up call next week? I'd love to hear how those initiatives we discussed have been progressing and share some specific thoughts on how we might be able to support your goals for Q4 and beyond.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. If you'd prefer, I can send over a quick overview of these ideas via email first - just let me know what works best for you.
